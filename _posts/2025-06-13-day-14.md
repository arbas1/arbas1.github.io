what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on my brain tumor project. I spent time looking for good data online, especially from websites like GEO and Xena Browser. At first, it was a bit confusing, but I’m slowly learning how to find the right kind of data like gene expression and sample information.
  
  I also learned how to download the right files and started to understand what they mean. Before, it just looked like a bunch of random text, but now I can tell what parts are useful.
  
  I tried reading some research papers too. They’re still a little hard, but I focused on understanding the methods and tools they used. That helped a lot.
  
  Overall, I feel like I made good progress today. I’m getting more confident and things are starting to make more sense.
blockers: |
  One of the biggest challenges today was figuring out which datasets were actually useful. Some had too much information or weren’t related to gene expression at all. It took time to understand what files to download and what each one meant.
  Another blocker was reading research papers. Some parts were really technical, and it was hard to follow the methods or tools they used. I had to reread things a few times to understand them.
  Also, searching with the wrong keywords made it harder to find what I needed, but I’m learning how to improve that

reflection: |
   Today, I realized that I’m slowly getting better at this. Even though some things were hard, like reading papers and finding the right data, I didn’t give up. I took my time and figured things out step by step. I feel more confident than I did before. I still have more to learn, but I’m proud of the progress I made today.
