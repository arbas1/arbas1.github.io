what_i_learned: |
  Today was our first in-person orientation for the internship, and it was a great start to the experience. We began the day with introductions, meeting our mentors and the organizers from CEAMLs. We also had a meaningful discussion about how AI is already impacting our daily lives and how it can be used as a powerful tool in research and innovation by Dr. Kofi Nyarko.
  After the discussion, we learned about defined and undefined models which was taught by professor Gabriella Waters, which gave us a foundational understanding of different AI model types. Then, we took a group photo to capture the moment. Following that, we participated in a fun and engaging team building activity where we had to build a tower that could hold a marshmallow on top, this encouraged collaboration and creativity and had a lot of fun.
  After lunch, we rejoined our mentor Dr. Roshan Poudel in our assigned rooms to dive deeper into our specific research projects. We discussed how we’ll approach our internship work over the coming weeks, the tools and software we’ll be using, and explored the main themes of our project, which focuses on RNA, DNA, and brain tumors. To build context, we reviewed a research paper completed by a previous group and began studying RNA sequencing and its connection to brain tumor research.
  After that, I also spent some time revising Python to strengthen my programming skills. Since machine learning is a new area for me, I started learning the basics. I explored concepts such as datasets, numerical data, measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance. I also learned about percentiles, histograms, normal data distribution, and scatter plots. It was a lot to take in, but I’m excited to keep learning more as the internship continues.
