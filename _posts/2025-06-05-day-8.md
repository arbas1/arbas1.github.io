  Today was a mix of discovery and teamwork. We started the day with a campus tour at Morgan State University. Everyone met at the business building, and from there, we began exploring the campus. Even though I’m a student here, I realized I haven’t seen a lot of the university. For example, I got to visit the engineering building for the first time today, which was exciting. It made me realize how big and full of opportunities the campus really is. Seeing new places on my own campus felt like exploring something familiar in a completely new way.
 After the tour, we had lunch and got some time to relax and connect with others. Then we jumped back into our work with our teams. We spent the rest of the afternoon working on our Python coding project. It was a good mix of focused work and helping each other. We shared ideas, fixed bugs, and supported each other as we made progress on the tasks. I really enjoyed working with my teammates today it felt like we were learning and growing together.
