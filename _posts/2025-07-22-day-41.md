what_i_learned: |
  We dedicated the whole day to refining our research paper in Overleaf. Our focus was on strengthening the introduction, methodology, and early results. With our mentor's insightful and thorough feedback, we were able to pinpoint sections that needed clearer explanations, greater precision, and more scientific rigor. We gained valuable skills in enhancing the academic tone of our writing, organizing our paragraphs more effectively, and maintaining consistency in citations and formatting. Their guidance also encouraged us to take a deeper, more critical look at how we described our machine learning techniques and results.
blockers: |
  No major blockers, though some of the feedback required significant rewriting which took more time than expected.

reflection: |
  Working on our paper in Overleaf helped us improve key sections like the introduction, methodology, and results. Our mentor’s feedback highlighted areas where we needed more clarity and precision. I learned how to write with a stronger academic tone and organize ideas more logically. It also made me reflect on how we present our machine learning methods to make them easier to understand.
