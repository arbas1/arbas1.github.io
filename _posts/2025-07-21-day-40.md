what_i_learned: |
  Today felt really productive and motivating. All the groups met in the Business Building, and it was nice being in a space where everyone was focused and working toward the same goal. Michael showed us how to use Overleaf to start putting our paper together, and even though I’d never used it before, he explained it in a way that made it easy to follow. I liked how it helped us stay organized and work together on one document without things getting messy.

After that, my group got together and we started planning out our paper. We talked about who would do what, and I decided to start looking into our top 10 genes. I spent time researching them and trying to find papers that could help us understand their roles better—especially in cancer. It actually made me more interested in our project because I could see the real science behind what we’re doing. Overall, today felt like a turning point. We’re finally pulling everything together, and I’m excited to see how far we can take it.
blockers: |
  Today, One of the blockers I faced today was finding solid research papers that mentioned all or most of our top 10 genes together. Most of the studies only focused on one or two at a time, which made it harder to connect everything for the discussion section. It also took a while to understand the biological roles of some genes since I don’t come from a strong biology background. 
  
reflection: |
   Today made me feel like we’re finally getting somewhere with our project. Being in the Business Building with all the other groups helped me stay focused, and learning how to use Overleaf made the writing part feel less confusing. It was also the first time I really started looking into our top 10 genes, and even though it was a bit hard at first, it made the project feel more real and interesting. I realized how important it is to understand the background of what we’re working on.
