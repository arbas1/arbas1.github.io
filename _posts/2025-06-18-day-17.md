  Today, Today was a really engaging and fun day. All the groups came together and we started by reviewing what we still need to work on. We had a group discussion about blog posts because a lot of us weren’t doing them correctly, so it was helpful to get some clarity. We also talked about the cheque process and what needs to be done for that.
  After the serious stuff, we lightened the mood by playing a fun guessing game with the high school teachers who will be joining us. They had to guess our project titles, and it was really fun and made everyone laugh. Then we played another team activity where we had to rank items we’d need if we were stranded in the middle of the ocean. It was super interesting and got us thinking creatively and working together.
  After lunch, we headed back to our room and met Mr. Richard, one of the high school teachers. We took some time to introduce ourselves and share our project—what we’re doing, where we’re at, and what’s next. It was nice to connect and get to know each other. We wrapped up the day by focusing on our data collection and cleaning. It was a good mix of learning, teamwork, and fun.

   Today felt both fun and productive. It was nice coming together with all the groups to talk about what still needs to get done, especially fixing how we’ve been writing our blog posts. The survival game where we had to decide what we’d need if we were stuck in the middle of the ocean really got us thinking and working together—it was fun but also made us reflect. I especially enjoyed the guessing game with the high school teachers; it was lighthearted and helped us connect. Meeting Mr. Richard was great too—we got to share what our project is about and hear his thoughts. Wrapping up the day by working on data collection and cleaning made me feel like we’re making good progress.
