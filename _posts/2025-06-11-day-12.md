what_i_learned: |
  Today,was a really engaging day. I started by finishing some machine learning videos that I didn’t get to watch yesterday. I focused on dummy variables and the dummy variable trap, and then did some coding exercises to understand how they work in real-world scenarios. Practicing with code made the concepts much clearer.
  Later, we had a Python quiz session, which was fun and a great way to learn. We didn’t always get the answers right at first, but we kept trying until we got them correct. It was a nice mix of challenge and teamwork.
  After lunch, we started our literature review. Our mentor TJ explained how to approach it and what to look for when reading a research paper. I focused on understanding the methodologies used, the tools applied, and how the researchers structured their work. This helped me figure out how to analyze academic papers better and gave me a clearer sense of how to apply those ideas to my own project. Overall, I feel like I grew both technically and academically today.
blockers: |
  One of the main blockers today was initially struggling to understand the dummy variable trap and interpreting the methodology section of the research paper, along with facing some confusion during the quiz questions before finally getting them right.

reflection: |
   Today, I focused on learning more about machine learning, especially dummy variables and the dummy variable trap. I practiced coding to understand the concepts better, which really helped me. We also had a Python quiz session where I made some mistakes but learned through trying again. In the afternoon, our mentor TJ guided us through how to do a literature review and what to focus on. I looked into the methodology and tools used in research papers, which helped me feel more confident in analyzing academic work.
