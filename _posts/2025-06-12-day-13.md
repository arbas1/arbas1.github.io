  Today,day, all the groups gathered at the business building to share updates on our research and what we’ve been doing so far. Each group had the chance to talk about their project progress, challenges, and what they’ve learned. It was really motivating to hear how everyone is approaching their work differently, and it gave us new ideas too. After that, we discussed what activities we should plan for next Thursday some fun suggestions came up like a field trip or visiting an amusement park, and everyone was excited to contribute.
  
  We then split into two teams and played a couple of games like Taboo and Jenga. Both were really fun and gave us a chance to bond and laugh together outside of our usual work routine. After lunch, we returned to our room and got back to working on our project.
  
  In the research portion, we focused on a few different things. Our mentor walked us through some of the code from last year’s project and explained what we should pay attention to—like how the code was structured, how data was processed, and how models were evaluated. This gave us a good starting point and helped us understand what we should aim for.
  
  Some team members started working on the literature review, searching for research papers related to predicting brain tumor biomarkers using machine learning and transcriptomic data. We looked for studies that used similar datasets or algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, or deep learning. Others focused on data collection, looking for reliable datasets from sources like TCGA and GEO. I was part of the group that started data cleaning, checking for missing values and formatting the gene expression data so it would be easier to work with later.
blockers: |
  One of the main blockers today included difficulties accessing and downloading large gene expression datasets, especially when they came in unfamiliar formats like .gz or .tar. We also ran into issues with slow internet and trouble accessing external resources like UCSC Xena and NCBI GEO.

reflection: |
   Today, was a fun and productive day. It was really nice to hear what other groups have been working on and see how far everyone has come. Playing games together made things feel more relaxed and helped us connect better as a team. When we got back to our project, I learned a lot—especially while reviewing old code, searching for research papers, and working on cleaning the data. I’m starting to see that research isn’t just about coding—it’s also about being curious, working together, and figuring things out step by step.
