  We spent the day polishing our research paper on Overleaf, making it clearer and more cohesive. Using the feedback we received earlier, we tightened up the methodology, made the results easier to understand, and fixed small formatting issues that had been bothering us. We also rewatched our elevator pitch video, and our mentor gave us some thoughtful advice on how to improve our delivery and make our message more engaging. He helped us rethink how we presented our main findings so they would leave a stronger impression. Later on, our faculty mentor stopped by and carefully went through our paper. His feedback was incredibly helpful he pointed out areas where we could sharpen our wording, bring out the most important ideas, and keep the academic tone consistent from start to finish.

reflection: |
   I realized how much progress we’ve made, not just in our writing, but in how we communicate our research overall. Getting feedback from both our mentor and faculty advisor pushed us to look at our work more critically, and it reminded me that good research isn’t just about data it’s also about how clearly and thoughtfully we present it. Revising our elevator pitch helped me understand the importance of delivery and tone in making our ideas resonate with others. It felt rewarding to see how much stronger our paper became through collaboration and careful editing. Today reminded me that research is a process, and every round of feedback helps bring us closer to something we can truly be proud of.
