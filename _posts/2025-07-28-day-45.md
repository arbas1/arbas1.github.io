what_i_learned: |
  Today was fully dedicated to preparing for our final presentation. I collaborated closely with one of our fellow participants to revise and polish the slides for our research showcase. We focused on improving visual clarity, ensuring smooth transitions, and refining the way we presented key points so that our message would be compelling and clear. I worked on organizing and refining the slides for our research presentation. I updated the content to use clear and simple bullet points, changed long sentences into short phrases, and made sure everything was in past tense. I also corrected spelling errors like "challenges" and added real points to sections that had placeholder text. This made the slides easier to understand and more presentable.After finalizing the presentation.

  Today, I focused on improving our research presentation slides. I simplified the content into short bullet points to make it clearer and easier to follow. I corrected spelling errors, fixed the formatting, and made sure everything was in past tense. These small changes made a big difference in how professional the slides looked. Overall, I feel more confident about presenting our project.
