what_i_learned: |
  This morning, we did our first complete run-through of the final presentation in front of our mentor and a high school instructor. They shared helpful feedback on areas we could improve, such as making transitions smoother, simplifying visuals, and presenting our findings more clearly. After reviewing their suggestions, our team went through each slide and made the needed adjustments. We then practiced again, and the second run felt much more polished, giving us a boost of confidence for the final day.

  No blockers today, just spent focused time revising and rehearsing to ensure quality.

reflection: |
  Today was an important turning point in preparing for our final presentation. Presenting in front of our mentor and the high school instructor gave us a chance to see how our work came across to an outside audience. Their feedback helped us notice details we had overlooked, and working through those together as a team strengthened both our slides and our collaboration. Doing a second run through after making changes made a big difference it felt smoother and more unified. It was rewarding to see our hard work coming together, and the progress gave us more confidence moving forward.
