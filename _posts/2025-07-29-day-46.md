what_i_learned: |
  This morning, we had our first full run-through of the final presentation in front of our mentor and one of the high school instructors. Their insights pointed out areas we could make stronger, like refining transitions, clarifying our visuals, and tightening the way we presented our findings. After receiving the feedback, we worked as a team to go through the slides carefully and make improvements. Once we made the necessary changes, we did another presentation run, which went more smoothly and gave us a confidence boost ahead of the final day.

blockers: |
  No blockers today, just spent focused time revising and rehearsing to ensure quality.

reflection: |
  Today highlighted the importance of practice and constructive feedback. Doing the presentation once and then revisiting it with improvements made a clear difference in our delivery. It was satisfying to see our efforts come together and even more motivating to realize how far our work has progressed. Moments like these really emphasize how much growth can happen through collaboration and iteration.
