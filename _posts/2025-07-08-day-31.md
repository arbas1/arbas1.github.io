what_i_learned: |
  Today, Today, I made strong progress in analyzing and visualizing gene expression data for tumor classification. I started by separating the data into Malignant and Benign groups and calculated how many samples belonged to each category. I identified the top 10 most overexpressed and most variable genes across all samples using log2 fold change and variance. Then, I created multiple visualizations to explore gene behavior, including bar plots, scatter plots, boxplots, dot plots, and strip plots. These graphs helped me clearly see which genes had significantly different expression between tumor types. I also used melt() to reshape the dataset and generate grouped plots with Seaborn to better interpret expression levels. Additionally, I examined the relationship between the top genes, plotted gene-gene comparisons, and visualized the distribution of expression values using histograms and heatmaps. All of these steps gave me deeper insight into the structure of my dataset, revealed patterns that distinguish tumor types, and helped me identify genes that may be useful for training a machine learning model.

  Today, One blocker I faced was managing the large dataset, which made some plots look crowded and harder to interpret. I also encountered issues when certain gene names like ACTB and MT-ND3 didn't match the actual dataset, causing errors in plotting. Reshaping the data correctly using melt() took a few tries to get right. Some visualizations, especially with many genes, became messy and difficult to analyze clearly. Lastly, distinguishing between Malignant and Benign samples visually was sometimes challenging when expression levels overlapped.

   Today, work gave me a deeper understanding of how important data visualization is before building any machine learning model. By exploring different types of plots, I was able to see patterns in gene expression that clearly separate Malignant from Benign samples. I also learned that not all genes are equally useful, and identifying the most variable or overexpressed ones is a key step in simplifying the analysis. Although I faced some technical challenges, like managing large datasets and formatting errors, overcoming them helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills.
