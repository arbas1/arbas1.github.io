what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on building a clean and professional flowchart that outlines my entire data processing workflow from collecting RNA seq data to cleaning, mapping, and preparing it for analysis. I made sure every step was short, clear, and easy to follow, and styled the design to look visually appealing for the final presentation.
  
  Alongside the flowchart, I worked on my PowerPoint presentation especially the “Data & Preliminary Findings” slide. I rewrote the content to be short, humanized, and presentation ready. I also spent time thinking about the visuals to include so that everything appears clean, meaningful, and well organized.
blockers: |
  A key blocker today was simplifying technical steps into short, clear flowchart labels while keeping the design clean and visually balanced.

reflection: |
   Today really showed me how much of a difference it makes when things are clear and easy to follow. While working on the flowchart, I had to think about how to turn all the detailed steps I’ve been doing into something simple and clean and honestly, that helped me understand my own process better too.
