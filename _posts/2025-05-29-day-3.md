  Today’s session began with an introduction to computer vision, led by Andrew Kelly. We used Google Colab to explore how computers can “see” and process images, and learned the basic difference between image classification and object detection. Image classification gives one label for an entire image, while object detection can find and label multiple objects within the same image using bounding boxes. We also learned about object tracking, which involves following objects across video frames by giving each one a unique ID, and image segmentation, which breaks down an image into parts and colors each segment based on the object it represents. We explored real-world applications of computer vision, like how self-driving cars use it to detect pedestrians and road signs. We also learned about the Teachable Machine by Google, which allows anyone to create a machine learning model using their own images or sounds by simply uploading data, training the model, and testing it. In addition, we discovered what a coding library is—essentially a collection of pre-written code that helps make programming faster and easier. We then looked at how YOLO V8, a popular object detection tool, works by dividing an image into grid cells and predicting bounding boxes for objects within each one. After the lesson, we played a digital escape room game that required solving puzzles using logic, visuals, and teamwork, which was a fun way to practice thinking critically. Later in the day, we worked on Python file handling and practiced writing to a file, reading from it, and appending new information. We also learned about the importance of using the correct file modes (w, r, a) and the different read methods (read, readline, readlines). Overall, the day was full of hands-on activities, coding, creativity, and teamwork.

  Today I learned how computer vision works using tools like Google Colab and Teachable Machine, and I also had fun solving puzzles in an escape room game. I practiced Python file handling and understood how to write, read, and update files properly.
