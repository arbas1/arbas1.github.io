what_i_learned: |
  Today was a really full and exciting day. We started off by learning more about lists and dictionaries in Python, which are super useful for organizing information in our code. At first, I mixed up a few things like using the wrong brackets or forgetting how to access values properly, but with some practice and help from others, it started to make sense. We also had a session with our mentor where we revised matrix concepts and discussed how they work, which was really helpful and brought back things I had learned before. It felt like a good refresh and connected well with the coding we’ve been doing.
  Later, we worked on creating a video for our project. We shared what our project is about, what challenges we faced, and the things we’re proud of. Talking through the struggles like getting stuck with bugs or figuring out how to explain our work in a simple way actually made me realize how much we’ve learned. It also reminded me how well we’re working together as a team.
  The best part of my day was finishing the Python course on Kaggle! I learned so much from it things like how to use variables, loops, functions, conditionals, and more. Some parts were a bit hard at first, but the step-by-step practice really helped. Finishing the course made me feel super accomplished and gave me a lot more confidence with coding.

blockers: |
  Today I faced a few blockers while working through the tasks. When coding, I sometimes got confused with the syntax for lists and dictionaries like using the wrong brackets or forgetting how to properly access or update values. Some of the exercises took a few tries because I missed small details or didn’t fully understand what the question was asking at first.

reflection: |
  Today I learned more about Python lists and dictionaries, and although it was tricky at first, it got easier with practice. Our mentor also reviewed matrix concepts with us, which was a helpful reminder of what I had learned before. We worked on a project video and talked about our struggles and progress.
