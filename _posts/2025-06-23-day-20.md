what_i_learned: |
  Today didn’t start as planned we had an issue with our room, so we had to pack up and move to a different one. It threw things off a bit, but once we got settled, we got back to work and picked up from where we left off last time. Our main focus today was trying to recover from a big setback: we had lost a lot of the data we previously collected, which was really frustrating. It felt like starting from scratch again.
  
  Most of my day was spent searching for RNA-seq data on brain tumors to replace what we lost. It wasn’t easy—the datasets are hard to find, and even when you find something, you have to double-check everything to make sure it’s actually useful. I went through a lot of samples and read through tons of details to make sure we were collecting the right kind of data this time. It took a lot of patience, but I was able to gather a good amount of data by the end of the day. Even though it was tough, I’m glad we made solid progress.
blockers: |
  One of the main blockers today was that I kept finding only small amounts of usable data. Even after searching through multiple sources, most datasets were either incomplete, too limited in sample size, or didn’t match what we needed for the project. It was frustrating and time-consuming because I had to dig through so many options just to find a few that were actually relevant. This made the data collection process feel slow and repetitive.

reflection: |
   Today felt a little overwhelming at times. Starting off with the room change already threw me off, and losing the data we had worked so hard to collect was honestly discouraging. I spent hours digging through databases, hoping to find what we needed, but most of what I found wasn’t enough just small pieces here and there. It felt like all the effort was adding up too slowly.
