what_i_learned: |
  Today was a productive and fun day. In the first half, our team focused on preparing for the final presentation scheduled for tomorrow. We reviewed our slides, discussed transitions, and made sure everything flowed smoothly. Later, we joined a potluck with the other groups, which was a great chance to relax, enjoy good food, and connect with everyone. After the potluck, we played some interactive games that helped lighten the mood and strengthen our teamwork. Toward the end of the day, we continued working alongside the other groups to finalize our presentations and support each other as we all get ready for the big day.

Later, we had a fun and interactive potluck with the other groups, which helped us relax and connect. Playing games afterward brought a lot of laughter and strengthened our team bond. We ended the day by collaborating with other groups to polish our presentations and support each other.
