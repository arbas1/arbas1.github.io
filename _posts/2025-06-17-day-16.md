what_i_learned: |
  Today, was a productive and insightful day. I focused on reading several research papers related to cancer biomarker prediction, especially for colon and brain tumors. I learned how different studies used techniques like PCA for reducing high-dimensional data, WGCNA for identifying gene co-expression modules, and immune infiltration analysis to explore how immune cells interact with tumors. I also saw how machine learning and deep learning models like logistic regression, random forest, and CNNs are used to classify tumor types and discover key genetic biomarkers.
  
  I paid special attention to how researchers selected important genes, applied feature selection techniques like SelectKBest and LASSO, and validated their findings using survival analysis and expression patterns. It gave me new ideas on how to improve and structure my own project more effectively.Later in the day, we also reviewed our PowerPoint presentation

   Today, I learned how different methods like PCA, WGCNA, and machine learning are used in cancer biomarker research. Reading the papers helped me understand how these techniques work together to find meaningful genes. Reviewing our PowerPoint presentation made me more confident in explaining our project.
