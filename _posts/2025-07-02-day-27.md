  Today, I worked on several parts of my RNA-seq brain tumor classification project. I focused on documenting and organizing the entire workflow step by step. This included collecting the data from GEO, labeling the samples as benign or malignant using tumor grade information, transposing the data to get it into the right format, mapping probe IDs to ENSG gene IDs, and then mapping those IDs to gene names so the data was easier to understand. After that, I combined all the different pieces of data into a single dataset, removed any missing values (NaNs), scaled the gene expression data so everything was on the same scale, and finally applied PCA to reduce the number of features. I also spent time creating and updating my flowchart to include each of these steps clearly and accurately, and I made sure it looked clean and professional for my presentation. In addition to working on the technical side, I improved my PowerPoint slides by adding visuals like the pie chart showing tumor type distribution and diagrams to help explain my methodology. Later, I practiced presenting everything out loud, explaining each step in simple language so it would be easier for my audience to follow. While doing this, I learned how important it is to communicate both what I did and why each step mattered.

  Today, I had a hard time finding the best way to improve the accuracy of my models, even after trying different supervised methods. It was challenging to figure out why the accuracy stayed around 77–79% no matter which approach I used. I also spent extra time making sure each step in the flowchart was labeled clearly and in the right order. Formatting the PowerPoint slides and making them look clean was sometimes difficult. Finally, I had to practice explaining all the technical details in simple terms so my presentation would be easy to understand.

   Today, I learned how important it is to be patient when working with real data, because improving model accuracy isn’t always straightforward. Even after trying different supervised methods, I realized that some limitations come from the data itself and not just the techniques. I also gained more experience organizing complex workflows into clear, step-by-step diagrams that are easier to present. Practicing my presentation helped me feel more confident explaining technical processes in simple language. Overall, this work taught me how to balance technical details with clear communication and to stay persistent when results don’t improve right away.
