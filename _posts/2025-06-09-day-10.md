what_i_learned: |
  Today we focused on learning machine learning, and our main topic was linear regression. At first, the idea seemed a bit confusing, but after talking it through as a group, it started to make sense. We learned how linear regression helps make predictions, like guessing someone’s salary based on their experience or estimating house prices. Then we jumped into some hands-on coding, which really helped. I worked with a few datasets like hiring.csv, homeprices.csv, canada_per_capita_income.csv, areas.csv, and prediction.csv. It was pretty cool to see how the numbers actually turn into something useful with just a few lines of code. I liked how we tested our models to see how accurate they were. It felt good to figure out how to read the data, run the model, and get predictions from it. Some parts were tricky—especially understanding all the steps—but trying different examples helped me understand it better. Overall, I feel like I’m slowly getting the hang of it, and I’m excited to keep learning more.

  Today I faced a few blockers while working through the tasks. When coding, I tried to convert word to number where I got error and got confused a lot.

reflection: |
  Learning about linear regression today helped me see how machine learning can actually be used to solve real problems. At first, it felt a bit overwhelming, especially when looking at all the numbers and code, but once we started doing hands-on practice with the datasets, things started to click. I realized that trying different examples and discussing with others made the learning process easier and more enjoyable. Even though I still have a lot to learn, I feel more confident than I did before, and I’m proud of the progress I made today.
