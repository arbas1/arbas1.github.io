  Today was a really productive and enjoyable day. We started off by learning about computer vision with Andrew Kelly, and we used Google Colab to try out some cool coding examples. I learned the difference between image classification and object detection—image classification just tells you what’s in a picture overall, but object detection can actually find and label multiple things inside the same image. We also learned about object tracking, which follows moving objects in videos, and image segmentation, which breaks an image into different parts and colors them based on what they are. It was really cool to see how this is used in real life, like in self-driving cars that need to recognize people, road signs, and other cars to stay safe.
  We also explored something called Teachable Machine by Google, which lets you train a machine learning model just by uploading pictures or sounds. It’s super easy and fun to use. Another thing we covered was coding libraries—they’re like toolkits made by other programmers that we can use to save time instead of writing everything from scratch. We even looked at how YOLO V8 works—it’s a tool that can detect objects super fast by dividing the image into grids.
  After that first session, we played a digital escape room game! It was such a fun way to challenge our minds and work together as a team. We had to solve puzzles using clues, numbers, cards, and patterns—it definitely got us thinking!
  Later, we switched to learning about file handling in Python. I learned how to create a text file, write things into it, read from it, and even add more text later. We talked about why it’s important to close a file when you’re done and how different read methods work. Overall, today was full of exciting lessons, fun challenges, and lots of learning.

  Today I learned how computer vision works using tools like Google Colab and Teachable Machine, and I also had fun solving puzzles in an escape room game. I practiced Python file handling and understood how to write, read, and update files properly.
