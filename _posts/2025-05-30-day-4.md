what_i_learned: |
  Today started with a Python lesson where we learned about reading data from files using methods like .read(), .readline(), and how to clean up unwanted characters using .strip() and .rstrip(). I understood how newline characters like \n can affect data and how slicing can help remove them. It was useful to see how data can be stored and accessed line by line.
  After that, we continued with a session on LLMs (Large Language Models) and Generative AI. I learned how AI has evolved from basic machine learning to deep learning and now generative models that create new content. We discussed the difference between traditional AI and GenAI, and I now know that GenAI is unique because it can generate new text, images, and even music.
  Then we played a Kahoot quiz to test our understanding of LLMs, and I actually got to apply what I learned during the presentation. We also had a fun activity where we guessed if a photo was AI-generated or real, which made me think more about how realistic AI-generated content can be.
  At the end, we used an AI tool called Suno to create music. It was fun and cool to see how AI can generate sounds and beats from simple prompts. I learned that prompt engineering really matters—how you ask the AI affects the result.

  Overall, I learned a lot about file handling in Python and the fundamentals of how large language models work. I also learned how creative AI can be and how important it is to understand the technology behind what we use every day.
