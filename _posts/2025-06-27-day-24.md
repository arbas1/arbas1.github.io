what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had a meeting with Dr. Roshan to discuss how we should be moving forward on our project. During the meeting, we talked about our progress so far, what still needs to be done, and how to plan our next steps effectively. After the discussion, I worked on creating a PowerPoint presentation for our project video, making sure it clearly explains our objectives, the methods we have used, and the results we have so far. I also started preparing another PowerPoint presentation that we will use for our in-person presentation on Thursday. I focused on organizing the slides so the content is clear, professional, and easy for the audience to follow. Overall, today was productive because it helped us align as a team and get ready to communicate our work confidently.

   Today’s meeting with Dr. Roshan really helped us figure out exactly what we should be focusing on next, which made me feel more organized and less stressed about the project. After the meeting, I worked on two PowerPoint presentations—one for our project video and another for our presentation on Thursday—to make sure everything looks clear and professional.
