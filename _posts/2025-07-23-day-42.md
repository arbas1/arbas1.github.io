what_i_learned: |
  We spent the entire day working on our research paper using Overleaf, focusing on refining the introduction, methodology, and results to ensure they were clear, precise, and met academic standards. With valuable feedback from our mentor, Dr. Roshan Poudel, we improved the structure of our writing and polished the scientific tone. We also took time to enhance the logical flow of each section and ensure proper citation formatting. Once the paper was complete, we shifted our attention to preparing for tomorrow’s elevator pitch. Together, we crafted a script that was informative, engaging, and easy to follow. We then began rehearsing to perfect our delivery and stay within the 60–90 second time frame.

blockers: |
  No major blockers, but balancing the writing and rehearsal took more time and energy than expected.

reflection: |
  It was a productive and demanding day.  Thanks to cooperation and real-time feedback, we were able to make great strides on our study paper.  We felt like we accomplished something after we finished the major pieces.  By switching to the elevator pitch, we were able to come up with innovative ways to explain our product to a larger audience.  We felt more confident in our writing and presentation skills as a result of the collaboration, edits, and practice sessions.  Tomorrow, we're excited to present our work.
