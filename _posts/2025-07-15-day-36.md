  Today was a valuable and interactive day in the Business Building. We started with a session led by a new teacher who introduced us to the Myers Briggs and VARK personality types. It was eye-opening to learn how our personalities and preferred learning styles impact how we collaborate and approach tasks. I realized how being aware of these can improve teamwork and even how we handle our research work more effectively.
  
  After the break, our research mentor had us each present our current project progress. This was a great opportunity to pause and reflect on everything we've done so far how we’ve written our code, processed our data, and interpreted results. I shared where I currently stand with my project and received constructive feedback that helped me see what’s going well and what I need to improve. Listening to others' presentations also gave me ideas and motivation for the next steps in my own work. Overall, today helped me better understand not just my project, but also how I work and learn best.

  Today, One challenge I’m currently facing is understanding the best way to identify truly overexpressed and underexpressed genes. Different plots (like bar charts vs. volcano plots) sometimes highlight different genes, which can be confusing. It’s also been a bit difficult to decide whether to use total expression values, mean differences, or statistical methods like log2FC. Additionally, due to the large dataset size, it’s sometimes slow to process or visualize the data efficiently.
  
reflection: |
   Today was a great mix of technical learning and self-awareness. In the Business Building session, I learned about my Myers Briggs and VARK personality types, which helped me understand how I learn and work best both independently and within a team. This self-awareness will definitely help in group research settings. Later, during our mentor session, we each presented our project progress and received personalized feedback. This helped me reflect on the choices I’ve made so far in my code and analysis, and where I can improve. I also made progress in identifying overexpressed genes, even though I’m still refining my method.
