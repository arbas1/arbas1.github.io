 Today was a really good day. We finally met our graduate mentor, TJ, in person. He shared a bit about his recent trip, and it was fun getting to know him better. We also had a session with our faculty mentor, Dr. Roshan Powdel, who taught us some basic Python like lists, fstring and functions. He also explained what Artificial Intelligence (AI) is and how it’s used in real life. We talked about different machine learning topics like logistic regression, decision trees, and conditional probability, which helped me understand how computers can make predictions using data. Later during my self-study time, I learned about multiple regression, how to scale data, how to split it into training and testing sets, and how to use a confusion matrix to check how well a model works. We also talked about “Unmasking AI” by Joy Buolamwini, which showed how AI can be unfair sometimes and why it's important to be careful when building it.
