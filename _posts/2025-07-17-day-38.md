what_i_learned: |
  Today felt really encouraging and productive. Our whole group went to the Business Building for a session with Dr. Anita Pandey, and her presentation was both helpful and motivating. She broke down what makes a strong scientific presentation—things like having a clear title, including key sections like the abstract, methods, results, and conclusion on each slide. What really stood out to me was her walkthrough of Overleaf. I’ve always found formatting a bit overwhelming, but she made it simple and showed us how to keep our writing formal and consistent without overcomplicating it.

  What made the day even better was how open and supportive the atmosphere was. We had an honest conversation about the challenges we’ve been facing with our projects, and it felt good to know we weren’t alone. Everyone shared their thoughts, and Dr. Pandey gave us real, practical feedback without making anyone feel discouraged. After that, we had a fun Kahoot session that made everyone laugh and relax a bit. Later, when we got back to the lab, my group focused on improving our paper’s introduction. We spent time reframing our research question and adding in new ideas to make it stronger. It was a full day, but I left feeling more focused and supported..

reflection: |
  Today’s session really made me reflect on how important structure, support, and clarity are in research. Dr. Pandey’s advice on organizing presentations and using Overleaf made the writing process feel much more approachable, and her emphasis on keeping an academic yet natural tone really stuck with me. I also appreciated the open discussion about the challenges we’re all facing it reminded me that struggling is part of the process, and we’re not alone. The feedback we received gave me a fresh perspective on how to improve, and working with my group afterward to reshape our paper’s introduction felt productive and encouraging. Overall, the day reminded me that growth happens when we’re open to learning and willing to adapt.
