what_i_learned: |
  Today, I dedicated my time to doing an in depth literature review for our brain tumor classification project. I focused on understanding different methodologies used in similar research especially how various machine learning models, such as SVM, Random Forest, and LASSO regression, are applied to transcriptomic data. I paid close attention to how other researchers handled feature selection, tumor labeling, and data validation. This gave me some useful insights into improving our own approach.
  
  In addition to reading papers, I spent time refining our PowerPoint presentation. I edited some of the slides to make them more concise and visually appealing, especially in the methods and preliminary findings section. I tried to make the content easier to explain to a wider audience without losing the technical depth. Overall, today was a learning-heavy day that helped strengthen both our project’s direction and the way we communicate it.

reflection: |
   Reviewing research papers today gave me a clearer understanding of the methods we can use for our project. It helped me see the importance of choosing the right approach based on existing studies. Updating the slides also made me realize how crucial it is to explain our work clearly to others.
