what_i_learned: |
  This week has been really exciting! We started by introducing ourselves and learning about Git and GitHub — how they work and how we’ll be using them during the internship. I also got more comfortable using Google Docs to collaborate with others. One of the things I’m most proud of is the website I created. With help from the mentors, I built a personal site that includes my own info. It was my first time doing something like this, and it felt great to see it come together. I’m really looking forward to learning more and improving my skills.
