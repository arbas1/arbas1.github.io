what_i_learned: |
   This first week of the internship was a really great experience. We started off by introducing ourselves, and I also got to meet my group members. The mentors even created separate Zoom rooms for each group, which made it easier for us to connect and talk more comfortably. It was nice to have that small space to get to know each other better.
We also took a placement test to see where we stand, and that helped me figure out what I should focus on. One of the most fun activities was the speed networking bingo. We had to talk to different people and get their names to fill out the card. It was super interactive and made meeting everyone way more fun and less awkward.
Throughout the week, we learned how to use Git and GitHub. Now I understand how these tools help with tracking code and working on projects as a team. I also practiced using Google Docs for sharing and collaborating.
We created a website with guidance from the mentors, I was able to build a simple site that has my information on it. It was my first time doing something like that, and it felt awesome to see it all come together. I’m really looking forward to what’s coming next in this journey.
