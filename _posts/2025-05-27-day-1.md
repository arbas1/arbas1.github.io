what_i_learned: |
  This week has been really exciting! We started by introducing ourselves and learning about Git and GitHub, how they work and how we’ll be using them during the internship. I also got more comfortable using Google Docs to collaborate with others. One of the things I’m most proud of is the website I created. With help from the mentors, I built a personal site that includes my own info. It was my first time doing something like this, and it felt great to see it come together. I’m really looking forward to learning more and improving my skills. We also took a placement test to see where we stand, and that helped me figure out what I should focus on. One of the most fun activities was the speed networking bingo. We had to talk to different people and get their names to fill out the card. It was super interactive and made meeting everyone way more fun and less awkward.
