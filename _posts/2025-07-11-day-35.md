what_i_learned: |
  Today, we spent most of the time going through the code with our mentor. We reviewed everything we had so far and tried to figure out what was missing or not working. We found a few problems, like undefined variables, missing functions, and parts of the code that were repeated or didn’t make sense. Going through it step by step helped us understand how the whole project is supposed to work.
  
  After that, I worked on fixing some of those issues. I normalized the gene expression data so that all values were between 0 and 1. Then, I used a method to find the genes that are most helpful in telling the difference between benign and malignant samples. I trained a Random Forest model and checked how well it performed using accuracy, F1 score, and ROC AUC. I also made some plots to visualize the top genes.

  Today, A major blocker today was that the code felt a bit disorganized, which made it hard to follow and troubleshoot. Some parts were repeated unnecessarily or overwritten, and it wasn’t clear which section was doing what. Figuring out how to normalize the data properly also took time, since the gene expression values had a wide range and some were very skewed. Another challenge was deciding which methods to trust for feature selection and how to interpret the results in a meaningful way. These issues slowed us down a bit, but reviewing everything together helped us get a clearer direction.
  
reflection: |
   Today was really helpful because it gave me a chance to slow down and really understand what’s happening in our project. Instead of rushing to build models or run analysis, we focused on reviewing the code, finding issues, and thinking about how to make it better. It showed me how important it is to have a clear and organized workflow — especially when working with complex data like gene expression. I also learned that sometimes fixing small problems can lead to big improvements in the results. Overall, I feel more confident about the direction we’re heading and more prepared to contribute to the next steps.
