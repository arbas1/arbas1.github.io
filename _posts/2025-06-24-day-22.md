what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on building a clean and professional flowchart that outlines my entire data processing workflow from collecting RNA seq data to cleaning, mapping, and preparing it for analysis. I made sure every step was clear and easy to follow, and styled it to look visually appealing for the final presentation.
  
  Alongside that, I worked on my PowerPoint presentation, especially the “Data & Preliminary Findings” slide. I rewrote the content to make it short, humanized, and presentation-ready. I also thought carefully about what visuals to include so that everything looks clean and well-organized.
  
  We also had a quiz session today, which was a good check-in to see how much we understood from our past work and helped reinforce the key concepts we’ve been using in the project.
  
  Overall, today was about organizing, visualizing, and presenting my work in a way that’s clear for others to understand.

  It was a bit hard to make the flowchart look both simple and complete at the same time. I had to go back and forth to balance clarity and detail. Making sure every step in the flowchart matched exactly with what I had done took more time than expected.

reflection: |
   Today really helped me step back and look at everything I’ve been working on. Making the flowchart wasn’t just about organizing the steps it actually made me realize how far I’ve come in this project. Turning all those little tasks into something visual made it easier to explain and also reminded me of how much I’ve learned. The PowerPoint part was a bit tricky because I wanted it to be clear but not boring. I kept adjusting the wording and layout until it finally felt right. The quiz we had also made me pause and double check my understanding. It was a good reminder to stay on track. Overall, today felt productive, and I’m proud of how things are coming together.
