what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned about brain tumors and how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being used to improve medical care, especially in diagnosing and treating tumors like gliomas. I studied the different types of brain tumors and how they affect the brain. My mentor showed me a real brain tumor dataset and guided me through data analysis, which helped me understand how important clean and organized data is for training AI models. I also learned about GoogLeNet, a deep learning model that can analyze MRI images and help detect tumors. I watched videos that explained the steps of machine learning from collecting data, cleaning it, training the model, testing it, and making predictions and I solved some math problems related to the concepts. I also did a literature review on the paper “Artificial Intelligence in Neuro-Oncology” by Khalighi et al. (2024), which helped me understand how AI can predict survival rates, identify tumor types without surgery, and assist doctors in choosing the best treatment. I found it interesting that combining MRI scans, genetic data, and patient history makes AI predictions even more accurate.

  At first I find it hard to do some research. I got confused if we are collecting the data or reading the paper

   I learned about brain tumors and how AI and machine learning are helping doctors detect and treat them more effectively. I explored different types of brain tumors and analyzed a real dataset with guidance from my mentor. I also learned about GoogLeNet, a deep learning model used to identify tumors in MRI images. Through videos and practice problems, I understood the basic steps of machine learning. Reviewing a research paper by Khalighi et al. (2024) helped me realize how AI can improve diagnosis, predict outcomes, and make treatment more personalized.
