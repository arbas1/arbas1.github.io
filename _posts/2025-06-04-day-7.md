what_i_learned: |
 Today was a really nice and productive day. We spent time learning more about AI how it works and how it’s being used in the real world. It made me think about how much AI is already part of our lives, even if we don’t always notice it.
 We also worked on the Kaggle Python course for practice and revision. Some of us finished sections and even got certificates, which was exciting. While doing that, we reviewed important Python concepts like if, else, and elif statements.We tried different methods of coding, it was a good way to refresh what we already knew and clear up anything confusing.
 One thing I really liked was how we helped each other. Some people in the group are new to coding, so those of us who are a little more familiar with it gave a hand. It felt good to support each other and learn together.
 Later, we also ended up talking about our different cultures. Since we’re all from different countries, it was cool to hear about each other’s backgrounds and traditions. It made the group feel even more connected.

  Today we learned more about AI and practiced Python together, using if-else and elif statements on Kaggle. We also helped each other out and shared bits of our cultures, which made the day feel fun and connected.
