what_i_learned: |
  Today was one of the most exciting days we've had so far. We had a special session with Dr. Chris S. Crawford from the University of Alabama, who gave us a glimpse into the amazing research his team is working on. He showed us how they’re using AI to control devices through muscle signals it was so cool! We even got to try it ourselves. By flexing our muscles and entering simple commands, we could make the device move.
  
  But the best part for me was flying a drone using that same technology. Controlling it with just muscle movement felt like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. It was fun, fascinating, and really made me think about how powerful and practical AI can be.
  
  Afterwards, we headed back to our own research lab. Since we had finished our literature review, we started working on the PowerPoint for our final presentation. It was nice to shift gears and start thinking about how to communicate our work clearly. Overall, today was full of learning, hands-on experience, and some much-needed inspiration for our own project.

  Today’s session with Dr. Chris S. Crawford was incredibly inspiring. We got to explore how AI can be used to control devices through muscle movements, which felt futuristic and exciting. Flying the drone using just muscle signals was the most fascinating part for me. It made me think about how powerful and practical these technologies could become in everyday life. Later, working on our final presentation reminded me how much progress we've made on our own research project.
