what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked on cleaning and labeling brain tumor dataset files from GEO. I learned how to identify which columns represent samples and how to label each sample as Tumorous, Non-Tumorous, or Unknown based on the disease state. It was a bit confusing at first, especially figuring out which part of the data needed labels, but going through the metadata rows helped me understand the structure better.
  
  I also practiced reading disease state terms like ASTROCYTOMA, GBM, and OLIGODENDROGLIOMA, and learned how each one is classified. I found out that ASTROCYTOMA and OLIGODENDROGLIOMA are also types of brain tumors, so they are labeled as Tumorous.
  
  Besides that, I learned how to work with Excel to clean up duplicate column names and delete them when needed—even though that part was tricky, I’m starting to get more comfortable with it.

reflection: |
   Today, I realized how important it is to understand the structure of real datasets. At first, I was confused about where to apply the labels, but by going through the metadata, things started to make sense. I also learned that small details like handling unknown labels or cleaning Excel columns can really impact the results.
