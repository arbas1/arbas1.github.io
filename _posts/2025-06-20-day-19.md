what_i_learned: |
  Today was a mix of excitement and some challenges. I started off by participating in a fun driving study at the engineering building. It was such a cool experience, and I really enjoyed doing something hands-on and different from my usual routine.
  
  Later in the day, we had a meeting with Dr. Paudel to talk about our project. During the meeting, he told us that the way we were cleaning and working with our data wasn’t correct. Honestly, it was a bit frustrating because it meant most of the work we had done so far wasn’t usable. We basically had to start over.
  
  After the meeting, my teammates and I went back to searching for new data and began labeling tumor types all over again. We focused on identifying which ones were malignant and which were benign based on the labels. It was a lot of detailed work, but we’re starting to get back on track.
  
  Even though it felt like a setback, I learned how important it is to be flexible, take feedback seriously, and work as a team when things don’t go as planned.

  One of the main blockers today was realizing that the way we had been cleaning and organizing our data was incorrect, which meant a lot of the work we had already done had to be thrown out. It was frustrating and discouraging to start over, especially after putting in so much effort. Finding new, accurate data took a lot of time, and making sure we were labeling tumors correctly as malignant or benign based on their names added to the challenge. The process was mentally tiring, and it slowed down our progress more than we expected.

reflection: |
   Today taught me the importance of being open to feedback and staying flexible when things don’t go as planned. Even though it was frustrating to hear that our previous work on data cleaning was incorrect, I realized that mistakes are part of the learning process. Starting over wasn't easy, but it helped me understand how critical it is to handle data carefully, especially when working on something as important as brain tumor classification. Working with my team to find new data and correctly label malignant and benign tumors reminded me that collaboration and patience are key. Despite the setbacks, I feel like I grew a lot in terms of both technical skills and mindset.
