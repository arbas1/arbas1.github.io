what_i_learned: |
  Today was a really productive and enjoyable day. We started by meeting our mentors, who will be guiding us through our projects. They explained what we’ll be working on and how we’re going to complete everything, step by step. Our mentor also shared that we’ll be learning from the basics, and that the internship will include both a literature section and a coding section to help us grow our skills. After that, we continued working on the website we started yesterday. We added some pictures and updated it with everything we had done the day before. Once that was done, we moved on to learning more about Python. We focused on dictionaries and lists, and did some coding exercises and assignments, like the store example. To end the day, we played a fun game together, which was a nice way to relax after all the learning

  Today was a fun and helpful day. We met our mentors and talked about how we’ll work on our projects. I liked adding pictures and updates to the website we started yesterday. We also learned about Python dictionaries and lists. The coding exercises were a bit tricky at first, but they made more sense after trying them out. At the end, we played a game, which made the day feel more fun and relaxed.
