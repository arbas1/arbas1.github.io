project_title: "Genetic Biomarkers & Machine Learning"

problem: |
  Brain tumors pose a significant challenge in medical diagnosis and treatment. Genetic biomarkers have the potential to provide accurate, personalized insights, but there remains a gap in utilizing machine learning to harness these biomarkers from large-scale genomic datasets.
  This project addresses that gap by aiming to develop machine learning models capable of classifying brain tumors based on transcriptomic data, improving early detection and diagnosis of cancerous and non-cancerous tumors.

approach: |
  The project follows a multi-step research process over 10 weeks:
  - Learn and apply Python, pandas, and other key libraries
  - Explore genomics and perform statistical data analysis
  - Train ML models (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, LASSO, Ridge) on RNA-seq datasets
  - Validate models using statistical metrics such as ROC and AUC
  - Perform dimensionality reduction and feature selection for gene classification
  - Prepare research outputs for publication or conference presentation

  Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook will be used for implementation. Public datasets from NCBI GEO will support data training and testing.

outcome: |
  By the end of the program, students will build and train ML models capable of identifying genetic markers related to brain tumors. They will gain hands-on experience in bioinformatics, data preprocessing, algorithm evaluation, and result visualization. The project aims to produce a manuscript for submission to a journal or conference and develop skills essential for careers in AI and biomedical data science.
